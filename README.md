# League of Legends Tournament info
Webscrapes lol.gamepedia.com for all tournament info from tournament names in csv. The names in the csv must match the format of lol.gamepedia.com in order to scrape properly. Some formatting is still necessary in order to make the csv file/pandas table fully capable of analysis but I just use the Excel file as a datasource for Tableau.
